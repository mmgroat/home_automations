# Home Automations

## Key benefits and uses of current home automations others might be interested in. Let me know if you are interested in any of the following, or would like me to share more on how to do them.

- Change lights when a server or application from work texts an error
- Change lights when taking a Zoom call or other designated process runs
- Change lights and announce on smart speakers when someone enters the home
- Reminders for chores, e.g, litter boxes, feeding the cats, or taking out the trash
- Morning alarms and wake up lights
- Remotely or locally pull up a map (on TVs, phones, or tablets) where household members are (for example, letting the household know you are on your way home from work)
- Alerts on smart speakers when someone arrives or leaves certain zones
- Pull up by a voice command, or show on a schedule (usually before waking), a calendar of the day's appointments on a TV
- Communicate remotely from a web browser entering text with household members through a smart speaker
- Random I love you reminders or videos on smart speakers or TVs

## Future Work

- Use a voice command, e.g. 'I just fed the cats', or 'I exercised for 30 minutes' that logs on a spreadsheet who (by voice recognition) did what and when, and optionally emails other household members the task or chore was completed
- A motion or presence sensor that triggers only once a day when first entering an office, greeting you and giving the day's appointments on a smart speaker - Later, a way to figure out who entered the room (face recognition, or cell phone or smart watch blue tooth presence detection)
- Slowly migrate away from Google Home and Google Assistants to Home Assistant with Voice Assistants running on Raspberry Pis connected to microphones and speakers (to avoid subscriptions and first adoptor bugs that I'm currenlty experencing trying to get Home Assistant Cloud to integrate with Google Home, and to run compeletly locally, independently from the Internet)
- Implement a local large language model (Ollama) for a better Home Assistant Voice Assistant that also does not require an Internet connection.
